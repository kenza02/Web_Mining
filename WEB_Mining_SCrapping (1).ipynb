This shift resulted in two camps: those who favor remote work and those who prefer the 40-hour work week in the office. Whatever people's opinion on them, work-from-home jobs are here to stay. A growing number of companies are offering full-time remote work and more employees are unwilling to return to a daily commute to an office.</p><p>That's because the benefits speak for themselves. When you work from home, you may have:</p><ul><li>Less or no time spent commuting.</li><li>More flexibility at work.</li><li>Better work-life balance.</li><li>Money saved on gas and family expenses such as day care.</li><li>Reduced chances of getting sick.</li><li>A healthier lifestyle.</li></ul><p>There are many <a href=\"https://www.monster.com/jobs/q-administrative-jobs\"  title=\"Administrative Jobs | Monster.com\">administrative jobs</a> and other types of jobs from home you can do with little or no formal experience, including:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.monster.com/jobs/q-freelance-writing-jobs\"  title=\"Freelance Writing Jobs | Monster.com\">freelance writing jobs</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.monster.com/jobs/q-clerical-jobs\"  title=\"Clerical Jobs | Monster.com\">clerical jobs</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.monster.com/jobs/q-customer-service-jobs\"  title=\"Customer Service Jobs | Monster.com\">customer service jobs</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.monster.com/jobs/q-tutoring-jobs\"  title=\"Tutoring Jobs | Monster.com\">tutoring jobs</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.monster.com/jobs/q-sales-associate-jobs\"  title=\"Sales Associate Jobs | Monster.com\">sales associate jobs</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.monster.com/jobs/q-online-teaching-jobs\"  title=\"Online Teaching Jobs | Monster.com\">online teaching jobs</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.monster.com/jobs/q-translator-jobs\"  title=\"Translator Jobs | Monster.com\">translator jobs</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.monster.com/jobs/q-online-data-entry-jobs\"  title=\"Online Data Entry Jobs | Monster.com\">online data entry jobs</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.monster.com/jobs/q-online-transcription-jobs\"  title=\"Online Transcription Jobs | Monster.com\">online transcription jobs</a></li></ul><p>Want to get into an advanced position?
